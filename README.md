<h1>⚫️ CS20 ⚫️ Ordinals on the Credits.com Blockchain </h1>
&nbsp;

<i></i>Version 0.1</i>
&nbsp;

This is a concept that aims to be the beginning for issuing ordinals inscriptions on the Credits Blockchain. Currently, there are several ordinals networks (BRC20, DRC20, LRC20, BSV20) where data is transferred into the blockchain through json and base64 inscriptions. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;



<h2>Hello ordinals world</h2>
&nbsp;

A distinction is made in this concept between the creation of different ordinals capabilities:
&nbsp;

1. <b>CS20 tokens</b>: JSON inscriptions that allow launching CS20 tokens without using smartcontract or layer2 tokens. These tokens can be minted by multiple wallets.

2. <b>SNS names</b>: Domain names that can be linked to a wallet, web3 and/or NFT for easy sending of tokens and/or viewing of ordinals

3. <b>CSmap</b>: Metaverse on the blockchain of Credits. Following Bitmaps and Dogemaps, where each block in the blockchain represents a piece of land with different parcels (transactions)

4. <b>NFT</b>: Images inscribed as Base64 code. For now, there are format/size limitations for using this option

5. <b>Web3page</b>: Simple one-page websites on the blockchain of credits

&nbsp;




<h2>Minting on the Credits Blockchain</h2>

&nbsp;

Through the following steps, you can easily inscribe, deploy and mint code into the Credits Blockchain

1. <b>Create a wallet -</b> Visit the website <a href="https://wallets.credits.com/" target="_blank">wallet.credits.com</a> and create a wallet
&nbsp;


2. <b>Destination wallet -</b> Once a wallet is created, you will need to enter the address below as the recipient of the transaction: ```CSoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo```
&nbsp;


3. <b>Amount in CS -</b> Fill in ```0,0001 CS``` as transfer amount
&nbsp;


4. <b>Max fee -</b> Leave this amount at ```0,1 CS```
&nbsp;


5. <b>Show additional fields -</b> Enter the appropriate ```deploy/mint code``` under "user data"
&nbsp;







&nbsp;
&nbsp;




<h2>Mint CS20 tokens</h2>

&nbsp;

The following codes can be used to mint a CS20 token

1. <b>Mint CS20 token CRED -</b> ```{ "p": "cs-20", "op": "mint", "tick": "cred", "amt": "1000" }```*
&nbsp;


2. <b>Mint CS20 token CSX -</b> ```{ "p": "cs-20", "op": "mint", "tick": "csx", "amt": "100000000" }```**
&nbsp;


3. <b>Mint CS20 token IGOR -</b> ```{ "p": "cs-20", "op": "mint", "tick": "igor", "amt": "10000" }```**
&nbsp;


'* <b>CRED</b> &nbsp; Total supply ```21,000,000``` &nbsp; Mint/limit ```1,000```
&nbsp;


** <b>CSX</b> &nbsp; Total supply ```24,947,107,200,000,000``` &nbsp; Mint/limit ```100,000,000```
&nbsp;


*** <b>IGOR</b> &nbsp; Total supply ```1,000,000,000``` &nbsp; Mint/limit ```10,000```
&nbsp;


   
&nbsp;

<h2>Mint SNS domains</h2>

&nbsp;

The following codes can be used to mint a SNS domain

1. <b>Mint SNS domain .CS -</b> ```{ "p": "sns", "op": "reg", "name": "yourname.cs" }```
&nbsp;


2. <b>Mint SNS domain .Credits -</b> ```{ "p": "sns", "op": "reg", "name": "yourname.credits" }```
&nbsp;




   
&nbsp;

<h2>Mint .CSmap</h2>

&nbsp;

The following codes can be used to mint a SNS domain

1. <b>Mint .CSmap -</b> ```{ "p": "csmap", "op": "reg", "name": "0.csmap" }```
&nbsp;
